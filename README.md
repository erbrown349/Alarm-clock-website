This FullStack Website allows you to see your current time within the area, and set an alarm, which plays a sound when setoff. In addition to this, the website saves previous alarm times you have used across multiple devices to a Database when the server is on. When the server is off, it temporary saves the last attempts used using the Frontend Coding.
